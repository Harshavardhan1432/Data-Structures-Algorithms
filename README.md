## Introduction

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science and software engineering. They play a crucial role in building efficient and scalable solutions to real-world problems. This repository aims to provide clear, concise, and well-documented implementations of various data structures and algorithms, along with explanations and examples.

## Data Structures

Explore the implementations of essential data structures in Java:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, etc.)
- Graphs (Directed Graphs, Undirected Graphs, Weighted Graphs, etc.)
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- and more!

Each data structure comes with detailed documentation and example usage to help you understand how it works and how to use it in your projects.

## Algorithms

Discover efficient algorithms implemented in Java:

- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.)
- Graph Algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming
- String Algorithms (Pattern Matching, String Manipulation, etc.)
- and more!

Each algorithm implementation is accompanied by explanations, time complexity analysis, and example applications to demonstrate its usage and performance.

## Contributing
